# üåü Fundamental Prompting Techniques for AI Models

Welcome to this quick guide on **Prompt Engineering Essentials** üß†  
Here you'll learn the *core prompting strategies* that help you get more accurate, consistent, and creative outputs from AI models.

## ü•á 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

**Description:**  
The most direct and simple approach ‚Äî you ask the model to perform a task without giving any examples.

**Example:**  
> Classify this movie review as positive, negative, or neutral:  
> _‚ÄúThe visuals were breathtaking, but the story lacked depth.‚Äù_

**When to Use:**  
- Straightforward or well-defined tasks  
- When the model already understands the topic  
- For quick, one-time queries

## üß© 2. One-Shot Prompting

**Description:**  
You provide *one* example to demonstrate the format or tone of the expected response.

**Example:**  
> Translate English to French:  
>
> **English:** ‚ÄúGood morning, how are you?‚Äù  
> **French:** ‚ÄúBonjour, comment allez-vous ?‚Äù  
>
> **English:** ‚ÄúWhere is the train station?‚Äù  
> **French:** 

**When to Use:**  
- When you need consistency in style or structure  
- Simple transformation or translation tasks

## üéØ 3. Few-Shot Prompting

**Description:**  
Provide *multiple examples* to establish a clear pattern or logic for the model to follow.

**Example:**  
> Convert customer feedback into structured JSON:  
>
> **Feedback:** ‚ÄúFast delivery but rude staff.‚Äù  
> `{"delivery": "positive", "service": "negative", "overall": "mixed"}`  
>
> **Feedback:** ‚ÄúAmazing food and friendly waiter.‚Äù  
> `{"delivery": "positive", "service": "positive", "overall": "positive"}`  
>
> **Feedback:** ‚ÄúCold pizza and long wait time.‚Äù  
> `{"delivery": "negative", "service": "negative", "overall": "negative"}`  

**Best Practices:**  
- Use **3‚Äì5 examples** for most tasks  
- Mix different cases or categories  
- Keep examples consistent and high-quality

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. System Prompting

**Description:**  
Define the AI‚Äôs overall **role, tone, and rules of behavior** at the system level.  
This ensures consistent behavior across all responses.

**Example:**  
> üó∫Ô∏è *System Prompt:*  
> ‚ÄúYou are a professional travel assistant. Always include:  
> - Main attractions  
> - Local etiquette  
> - Budget tips  
> - Best visiting seasons.‚Äù  
>
> **User:** Tell me about visiting Kyoto.

**When to Use:**  
- Building chatbots or AI assistants  
- Maintaining consistent role-based behavior

## üë©‚Äçüíª 5. Role Prompting

**Description:**  
Assign the AI a specific **persona or expertise** to improve accuracy and realism.

**Example:**  
> ‚ÄúAct as a senior data engineer. Suggest a scalable data pipeline architecture for a SaaS application.‚Äù

**Effective Roles:**  
- üéì Subject Matter Experts (doctor, teacher, lawyer)  
- üé® Creative Roles (writer, designer, poet)  
- üìä Analytical Roles (consultant, analyst)  
- üí¨ Communication Styles (friendly tutor, formal advisor)  

---

## üß© 6. Contextual Prompting

**Description:**  
Provide **relevant background or situational context** before asking the main question.

**Example:**  
> **Context:** You‚Äôre writing for a beginner-level tech blog.  
> Explain what an API is in **simple and relatable** language (around 200 words).  

**When to Use:**  
- Tasks needing domain or audience awareness  
- Blog writing, teaching, or client communication
